Small side-project dedicated to fetching RSU of Kosygin and turning it into ICS for calendar apps. This helped me understand HTML, requests, and deepen my knowledge in pandas.

**Old TBA (Abandoned due to my enlightenment):**
- ~~webhook/fetch script~~
- ~~.xslx to .csv conversion~~
- ~~.csv parser~~
- ~~.csv to .ics conversion~~
- ~~readme extension, instructions~~
- ~~Optional: add a simple CLI/GUI~~

**New TBA:**
- [x] fetch script
- [x] .xlsx to Pandas Dataframe conversion
- [x] Dataframe to .ics conversion
- [ ] readme extension, instructions
- [ ] Optional: add a simple CLI/GUI
- [ ] Make a function that automatically calculates dates and weekdays for the first events
- [ ] Make class or function that autoextracts data from cells

> Please note that this project is being vibecoded in a way "I don't use AI but I only code the stuff the way I want" so some things may be implemented way less elegant or efficient than they could and some can become quite overcomplicated.
